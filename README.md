# Deep_Learning_in_Computer_Vision

## Course Description:
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computer can be made to understand the useful information from digital images or videos (sequence of images). The goal of computer vision is to seeks to automates tasks that the human visual system can do, for instance, image classification, object localization, object detection, and depth perception etc. Modern computer vision has been greatly advanced by deep learning, a specific subset of machine learning. This course aims at understanding the basic concept of neural network and deep learning, with a focus on applying deep learning in solving computer vision tasks. During the course, students will learn to implement, train and debug different neural networks and understand the cutting-edge research in computer vision.
